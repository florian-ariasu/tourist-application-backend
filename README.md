3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

#### 🧪 Testing

Our testing suite covers key functionality:

- Museum operations validation
- Group management scenarios
- Event notification testing  
- Exception handling verification

To run tests:

```bash
gradle test
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run tests through IntelliJ's sidebar instead of terminal for better visibility

> [!TIP]
> IDE Integration
> IntelliJ IDEA users can leverage the included Gradle Wrapper (`gradle/wrapper`) for seamless integration:
- Automatic project recognition
- Direct access to Gradle tasks via sidebar
- No additional plugin requirements

### 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

#### 📐 Design Patterns

##### 1. Singleton Pattern 🔒
Used for the `Database` class to ensure a single source of truth:
- Prevents data inconsistency
- Provides centralized data access

##### 2. Builder Pattern 🏗️
Implemented for the `Group` class:
- Enables flexible object construction
- Supports optional parameters
- Implements method chaining
- Improves code readability

##### 3. Factory Pattern 🏭
Handles `Person` object creation:
- Creates `Student` and `Professor` instances dynamically
- Centralizes object creation logic
- Supports extensibility for new person types

##### 4. Command Pattern ⚡
Manages operations through dedicated command classes:
- Separates command invocation from execution
- Supports operation queuing
- Enables easy addition of new commands

##### 5. Observer Pattern 👀
Implements event notification system:
- Museums (`Subject`) notify groups guide (`Observer`)
- Real-time updates for schedule changes
- Decoupled communication between entities

#### 🎯 OOP Principles

##### Core Principles Implementation
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public accessors
- **Inheritance**: Base `Person` class with specialized extensions
- **Polymorphism**: Dynamic object behavior through Factory Pattern
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces for clear separation

#### ⚠️ Error Handling

**Custom exceptions** for robust operation:
```java
GroupNotExistsException
GroupThresholdException
GuideExistsException
GuideTypeException
PersonNotExistsException
```

#### 🔄 Data Processing

- CSV-like file processing ('|' delimiter)
- Multiple input format support
- Command-based operation
- Standardized output formatting
